# Regression Residual Trading

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Overview
The foundation of this trading strategy is that traders will trade similar securities in a similar fashion. Let's assume there are only two stocks $S_1$ and $S_2$. Say $S_1$ increases by $10\%$, traders would expect either $S_1$ to decrease back to its original value or $S_2$ to increase and meet $S_1$.


This idea can be profited from by shorting $S_1$ and going long $S_2$. The following trading strategy will mathematical describe and refine this idea, which will theoretically allow us to profit consistently on trades.
